#Practice using R Markdown 

The summer started yesterday. We:

- Ran over introductions
- Island tour
- Shopping

Here is a website I click: <httw://jamdinlab.org>

Here is how you do an equation:

$$ x^2 = \frac{y^2}3 $$
If you need more help go to the help tab above and lick Markdown Quick Reference.

I am **so** *excited* to be here in the beautiful Hawai'i.

This is how you create R looking script:
```
{r} echo=FALSE

#Histogram of ant heights
hist(rnorm(1000))

```
**Git!**

#To get get started, go to tools -> version control -> click the only box there -> then make sure there is git in the drop down tab and click that. R will restart 

Really fun day of coding.
