Day1\_R
================

Practice using R Markdown
=========================

The summer started yesterday. We:

-   Ran over introductions
-   Island tour
-   Shopping

Here is a website I click: &lt;httw://jamdinlab.org&gt;

Here is how you do an equation:

$$ x^2 = \\frac{y^2}3 $$
 If you need more help go to the help tab above and lick Markdown Quick Reference.

I am **so** *excited* to be here in the beautiful Hawai'i.

This is how you create R looking script:

    {r} echo=FALSE

    #Histogram of ant heights
    hist(rnorm(1000))

**Git!**

To get get started, go to tools -&gt; version control -&gt; click the only box there -&gt; then make sure there is git in the drop down tab and click that. R will restart
